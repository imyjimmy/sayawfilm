          <p>Loyola toured internationally as a principal dancer of the Bayanihan Philippine National Folk Dance Company from 1989-98. Considered a protégé of choreographer Lucrecia Reyes- Urtula, who was awarded the prestigious Philippine’s National Artist for Folk Dance and was the founding dance director of the Bayanihan Dance Company, Jay served as the Company’s Junior Assistant Dance Director in 1994-96. He taught Philippine folk dance workshops in the Philippines and for international festivals and conferences such as Singapore Arts Festival; Kaliningrad International Dance Festival in Russia, Konnichiwa Festival in Tokyo, Macau Arts Festival in China and the Philippine International Dance Festival and World Folklore Festival under the auspices of Conseil International des Organisations de Festivals de Folklore et d’Arts Traditionnels in France, Germany, Italy and the Philippines.</p>
					<p>Loyola began dancing at age of five. Folk dance became an integral a part of his life through his elementary and high school years as a member of the Holy Trinity College Dance Company. He performed for numerous civic and community festivals and gatherings as well as folk dance competitions. While a student at the University of Santo Tomas, he was recruited by the prestigious Bayanihan Philippine National Folk Dance Company to train and perform.</p>
					<p>Although raised in Palawan, Jay Loyola was first introduced to the rich cultural tradition of Tagbanua tribe in 1996 on a dance field research with the Bayanihan Dance Company. Loyola formed a deep kinship with Palawan’s native people, and was adopted into the Tagbanua tribe in Napsan. There, he participated in sacred rituals, traditional weddings, healing dances, and cultural practices of the tribe. Concerned that Tagbanua youth were not learning or practicing the traditional art forms, Loyola established the all-indigenous Palawan Dance Theater. Supported by the Palawan Center for the Arts Foundation, Palawan Dance Theatre became a vehicle to preserve and present the traditional Palawan culture through innovative choreography and stage presentation. Dancers and musicians were trained not only in technique and performance, but also in research and documentation of tribal customs.</p>

          <h3>Principle Dancer, Shaman</h3>
          <p>Jonathan is originally from San Jose, CA and moved to San Francisco just a few years ago. He had no technical dance training in Philippine Folk dance when he started 6 years ago. Jonathan’s first love is Hip Hop but has however developed a passion for Philippine Ethnic dance through PCN at San Francisco State University.
          </p>
        	<p>In his words, Philippine Dance allows Jonathan to connect to his culture. He was not taught how to be Filipino, he did not learn it though books or school. Dancing helped him learn that his culture is more than just lechon or adobo and the Philippine flag. Dance gives him the opportunity to showcase that he is Filipino and very proud of it.
